<h1>Roblox SCP: The Red Lake Script - Infinite Ammo</h1>

The newly released script for the Roblox game *SCP: The Red Lake* offers a valuable advantage with its Infinite Ammo feature, streamlining combat by eliminating the need to reload or scavenge for additional ammunition. Though its functionality is focused solely on this perk, it significantly eases gameplay in the zombie survival title, where players must defend a generator against relentless waves of enemies. Since its 2020 launch, the game has attracted over 6.6 million players, and this script—available for free on the creator’s website—provides a tactical edge for those struggling to survive the intense challenges.
